            COACH - ON YOUR OWN TIME
          </h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-7">
            With their new campaign ON YOUR OWN TIME, Coach invites everyone to
            find their own pace - far from societal expectations and the
            constant drive for self-optimization. Inspired by the spirit of New
            York, the campaign encourages people to take a moment amidst the
            chaos, to listen to themselves, and to have the courage to be
            authentic. The collection celebrates personal freedom, individual
            expression, and the many facets of oneâ€™s identity. As the Original
            American House of Leather, Coach has stood for craftsmanship and a
            strong identity since 1941. As a brand, a community, and a platform,
            Coach is a place for everyone who wants to write their own story -
            in their own time and in their own way.
