              With their new campaign ON YOUR OWN TIME, Coach invites everyone
              to find their own pace - far from societal expectations and the
              constant drive for self-optimization. Inspired by the spirit of
              New York, the campaign encourages people to take a moment amidst
              the chaos, to listen to themselves, and to have the courage to be
              authentic. The collection celebrates personal freedom, individual
              expression, and the many facets of oneâ€™s identity. As the Original
              American House of Leather, Coach has stood for craftsmanship and a
              strong identity since 1941. As a brand, a community, and a
              platform, Coach is a place for everyone who wants to write their
              own story - in their own time and in their own way.
